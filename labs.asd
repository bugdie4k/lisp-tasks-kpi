;; ':serial t' says that each sub-component in ':components' list depends on the previous components
;; and otherwise this file is pretty srlf-explanatory.
;;
;; So the the sequence of loading files must be like this:
;;
;; ------------------------
;; utils {
;;        utils.lisp ->
;;        my-tests.lisp
;;       } ->
;; package ->
;; src {
;;      labs1thru6.lisp
;;      lab7.lisp
;;     }
;; ------------------------
;;
;; (this notation is made up by me)
